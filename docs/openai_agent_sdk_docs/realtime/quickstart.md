# Quickstart

Realtime agents in the Python SDK are server-side, low-latency agents built on the OpenAI Realtime API over WebSocket transport.

!!! warning "Beta feature"

    Realtime agents are in beta. Expect some breaking changes as we improve the implementation.

!!! note "Python SDK boundary"

    The Python SDK does **not** provide a browser WebRTC transport. This page only covers Python-managed realtime sessions over server-side WebSockets. Use this SDK for server-side orchestration, tools, approvals, and telephony integrations. See also [Realtime transport](transport.md).

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10 or higher
-   OpenAI API key
-   Basic familiarity with the OpenAI Agents SDK

## Installation

If you haven't already, install the OpenAI Agents SDK:

```bash
pip install openai-agents
```

## Create a server-side realtime session

### 1. Import the realtime components

```python
import asyncio

from agents.realtime import RealtimeAgent, RealtimeRunner
```

### 2. Define the starting agent

```python
agent = RealtimeAgent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful voice assistant. Keep responses short and conversational.",
)
```

### 3. Configure the runner

Prefer the nested `audio.input` / `audio.output` session settings shape for new code. For new realtime agents, start with `gpt-realtime-1.5`.

```python
runner = RealtimeRunner(
    starting_agent=agent,
    config={
        "model_settings": {
            "model_name": "gpt-realtime-1.5",
            "audio": {
                "input": {
                    "format": "pcm16",
                    "transcription": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini-transcribe"},
                    "turn_detection": {
                        "type": "semantic_vad",
                        "interrupt_response": True,
                    },
                },
                "output": {
                    "format": "pcm16",
                    "voice": "ash",
                },
            },
        }
    },
)
```

### 4. Start the session and send input

`runner.run()` returns a `RealtimeSession`. The connection is opened when you enter the session context.

```python
async def main() -> None:
    session = await runner.run()

    async with session:
        await session.send_message("Say hello in one short sentence.")

        async for event in session:
            if event.type == "audio":
                # Forward or play event.audio.data.
                pass
            elif event.type == "history_added":
                print(event.item)
            elif event.type == "agent_end":
                # One assistant turn finished.
                break
            elif event.type == "error":
                print(f"Error: {event.error}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

`session.send_message()` accepts either a plain string or a structured realtime message. For raw audio chunks, use [`session.send_audio()`][agents.realtime.session.RealtimeSession.send_audio].

## What this quickstart does not include

-   Microphone capture and speaker playback code. See the realtime examples in [`examples/realtime`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/realtime).
-   SIP / telephony attach flows. See [Realtime transport](transport.md) and the [SIP section](guide.md#sip-and-telephony).

## Key settings

Once the basic session works, the settings most people reach for next are:

-   `model_name`
-   `audio.input.format`, `audio.output.format`
-   `audio.input.transcription`
-   `audio.input.noise_reduction`
-   `audio.input.turn_detection` for automatic turn detection
-   `audio.output.voice`
-   `tool_choice`, `prompt`, `tracing`
-   `async_tool_calls`, `guardrails_settings.debounce_text_length`, `tool_error_formatter`

The older flat aliases such as `input_audio_format`, `output_audio_format`, `input_audio_transcription`, and `turn_detection` still work, but nested `audio` settings are preferred for new code.

For manual turn control, use a raw `session.update` / `input_audio_buffer.commit` / `response.create` flow as described in the [Realtime agents guide](guide.md#manual-response-control).

For the full schema, see [`RealtimeRunConfig`][agents.realtime.config.RealtimeRunConfig] and [`RealtimeSessionModelSettings`][agents.realtime.config.RealtimeSessionModelSettings].

## Connection options

Set your API key in the environment:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Or pass it directly when starting the session:

```python
session = await runner.run(model_config={"api_key": "your-api-key"})
```

`model_config` also supports:

-   `url`: Custom WebSocket endpoint
-   `headers`: Custom request headers
-   `call_id`: Attach to an existing realtime call. In this repo, the documented attach flow is SIP.
-   `playback_tracker`: Report how much audio the user has actually heard

If you pass `headers` explicitly, the SDK will **not** inject an `Authorization` header for you.

When connecting to Azure OpenAI, pass a GA Realtime endpoint URL in `model_config["url"]` and explicit headers. Avoid the legacy beta path (`/openai/realtime?api-version=...`) with realtime agents. See the [Realtime agents guide](guide.md#low-level-access-and-custom-endpoints) for details.

## Next steps

-   Read [Realtime transport](transport.md) to choose between server-side WebSocket and SIP.
-   Read the [Realtime agents guide](guide.md) for lifecycle, structured input, approvals, handoffs, guardrails, and low-level control.
-   Browse the examples in [`examples/realtime`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/realtime).
